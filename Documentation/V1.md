## Using custom endpoint url
To use custom endpoint url you will need to know what resource type will be returned.
You can do that by checking return type of predefined API endpoints in `PatreonAPIv1` class.
Down below is code sample on how to get list of pledges using custom url with parameters.

```csharp
var url = "https://patreon.com/api/oauth2/api/campaigns/70261/pledges?page%5Bcount%5D=10&sort=created&page%5Bcursor%5D=2017-08-21T20%3A16%3A49.258893%2B00%3A00";
var query = new PatreonAPIv1Query<PatreonResponseMulti<PatreonPledgeV1Attributes, PatreonPledgeV1Relationships>, PatreonPledgeV1Attributes, PatreonPledgeV1Relationships>(url, httpClient, tokenManager);
var campaignPledges = await query.ExecuteAsync();
```
