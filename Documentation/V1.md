# Patreon V1 API
This page contains information and code samples on how to access Patreon V1 API using this library.

## Notes
By default V1 API will return all properties with some top level includes.
Setting top level includes manually will override top level include set by default.

When requesting some of resources in V1 API they will have sensible defaults for what attributes are included.
But you can request optional attributes manually.

Code samples will show all available possible top level includes and optional fields.

## Prerequisites
```csharp
var httpClient = new HttpClient();
var tokenManager = new PatreonSimpleTokenManager("access_token");
var patreonAPIv1 = new PatreonAPIv1(httpClient, tokenManager);
```

# API endpoint code samples

## [Fetching a patron's profile info](https://docs.patreon.com/#fetching-a-patron-39-s-profile-info)
```csharp
var currentUser = await PatreonAPIv1.CurrentUser()
  .Include(PatreonTopLevelIncludes.V1.CurrentUser.Campaign)
  .Include(PatreonTopLevelIncludes.V1.CurrentUser.Pledges)
  .ExecuteAsync();
```

## [Fetch a creator profile and campaign info](https://docs.patreon.com/#fetch-a-creator-profile-and-campaign-info)
```csharp
var currentUserCampaigns = await PatreonAPIv1.CurrentUserCampaigns()
  .Include(PatreonTopLevelIncludes.V1.CurrentUserCampaigns.Creator)
  .Include(PatreonTopLevelIncludes.V1.CurrentUserCampaigns.Goals)
  .Include(PatreonTopLevelIncludes.V1.CurrentUserCampaigns.Rewards)
  .Include(PatreonTopLevelIncludes.V1.CurrentUserCampaigns.Pledges)
  .ExecuteAsync();
```

## [Paging through a list of pledges](https://docs.patreon.com/#paging-through-a-list-of-pledges)
```csharp
var campaignId = 0;
var campaignPledges = await PatreonAPIv1.CampaignPledges(campaignId)
  .Include(PatreonTopLevelIncludes.V1.CampaignPledges.Address)
  .Include(PatreonTopLevelIncludes.V1.CampaignPledges.Creator)
  .Include(PatreonTopLevelIncludes.V1.CampaignPledges.Patron)
  .Include(PatreonTopLevelIncludes.V1.CampaignPledges.Reward)
  .ExecuteAsync();
```

## Using custom endpoint url
To use custom endpoint url you will need to know what resource type will be returned.
You can do that by checking return type of predefined API endpoints in `PatreonAPIv1` class.
Down below is code sample on how to get list of pledges using custom url with parameters.

```csharp
var campaignId = 0;
var url = $"https://patreon.com/api/oauth2/api/campaigns/{campaignId}/pledges?page%5Bcount%5D=10&sort=created&page%5Bcursor%5D=2017-08-21T20%3A16%3A49.258893%2B00%3A00";
var query = new PatreonAPIv1Query<PatreonResponseMulti<PatreonPledgeV1Attributes, PatreonPledgeV1Relationships>, PatreonPledgeV1Attributes, PatreonPledgeV1Relationships>(url, httpClient, tokenManager);
var campaignPledges = await query.ExecuteAsync();
```
