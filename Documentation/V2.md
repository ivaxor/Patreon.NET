# Patreon V2 API
**BE AWARE THAT PATREON V2 API IS STILL IN BETA. WHILE THE SCOPES AND ENDPOINTS ARE STABLE, THE SPECIFIC PROPERTIES RETURNED ON THE RESOURCES MAY CHANGE. SUCH CHANGES MAY BROKE THIS LIBRARY PARTIALLY OR COMPLETELY.**

## Notes
With V2 API, all properties must be individually requested. There are no more default properties on resources.

## Prerequisites
```csharp
var httpClient = new HttpClient();
var tokenManager = new PatreonSimpleTokenManager("access_token");
var patreonAPIv2 = new PatreonAPIv2(httpClient, tokenManager);
```

# API resource features code samples

## Requesting individual base resource properties
You can include individual properties by using `IncludeField` method with selector.

```csharp
var identity = await patreonAPIv2.Identity()
  .IncludeField(_ => _.Email)
  .IncludeField(_ => _.FirstName)
  .IncludeField(_ => _.Url)
  .ExecuteAsync();
```

## Requesting all base resource properties
You can include all properties by using `IncludeAllFields` method.

```csharp
var identity = await patreonAPIv2.Identity()
  .IncludeAllFields()
  .ExecuteAsync();
```

## Requesting additional resources
You can include additional resources by using `Include` method with top-level include resource name.
Please, note that by default even additional resources will be returned without any properties, so you will need to specify all properties individually.

```csharp
var identity = await patreonAPIv2.Identity()
  .Include(PatreonTopLevelIncludes.V2.Identity.Memberships)
  .ExecuteAsync();
```

## Requesting individual additional resources properties
You can include all additional resources properties by using `IncludeField` generic method with type associated with such additional resource and selector.

```csharp
var identity = await patreonAPIv2.Identity()
  .Include(PatreonTopLevelIncludes.V2.Identity.Campaign)
  .IncludeField<PatreonCampaignV2Attributes>(_ => _.OneLiner)
  .IncludeField<PatreonCampaignV2Attributes>(_ => _.PatronCount)
  .IncludeField<PatreonCampaignV2Attributes>(_ => _.Summary)
  .IncludeField<PatreonCampaignV2Attributes>(_ => _.Url)
  .ExecuteAsync();
```

## Requesting all additional resources properties
You can include all additional resources properties by using `IncludeAllFields` generic method with type associated with such additional resource.

```csharp
var identity = await patreonAPIv2.Identity()
  .Include(PatreonTopLevelIncludes.V2.Identity.Memberships)
  .IncludeAllFields<PatreonMemberAttributes>()
  .ExecuteAsync();
```

## Complex queries
You can come up with complex queries combining base and additional resources with any combination of individual or all properties gathering such as next one:

```csharp
var identity = await patreonAPIv2.Identity()
  .IncludeField(_ => _.Email)
  .IncludeField(_ => _.FirstName)
  .IncludeField(_ => _.Url)
  .Include(PatreonTopLevelIncludes.V2.Identity.Memberships)
  .IncludeAllFields<PatreonMemberAttributes>()
  .Include(PatreonTopLevelIncludes.V2.Identity.Campaign)
  .IncludeField<PatreonCampaignV2Attributes>(_ => _.OneLiner)
  .IncludeField<PatreonCampaignV2Attributes>(_ => _.PatronCount)
  .IncludeField<PatreonCampaignV2Attributes>(_ => _.Summary)
  .IncludeField<PatreonCampaignV2Attributes>(_ => _.Url)
  .ExecuteAsync();
```
